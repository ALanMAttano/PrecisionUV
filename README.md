## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Import the texture into your 3D software (e.g., RizomUV, Rhino, Painter, Blender).
2. Apply it to your object’s material
3. Enter UV Editor / Unwrap tool and start unwrapping
4. Adjust UVs for scale uniformity & orientation using the visible numbered cells and arrows

Pro Tip: Use this with reflective or displaced shaders to quickly catch misalignments.
