# 🎯 PrecisionUV — Designer UV Grid Texture for 3D Workflows

A **high-contrast, ultra-readable UV grid texture** crafted for accurate unwrapping and model optimization. Designed for clarity at all angles and scales. Compatible with Rhino, Blender, Unreal Engine, Unity, and Substance.

> “A beautiful texture isn't just about surface — it's how it maps the soul of geometry.” — *Inspired by Pininfarina & Frers spirit*

## 🚀 Features and Technical Highlights

- 💎 Specific for unwrapping Mesh, NURBS and SubD workflows.
- 🏁 **Hi resolution clean Texture Checker Grid for UV Mapping:** Purpose-built for UV layout workflows with maximum contrast and clarity.
- 💯 **Multiple Resolutions Available:** Includes 8K, 4K, 2K, and 1K — perfect sharp in any resolution for any performance or precision.
- 🧱 **High-Density Grid + Pixel Noise:** Great for testing filtering, mip-mapping, and blurry unwraps.
- 🎯 **Numbered coordinates** from [0,0] to [1,1]
- ✅ **PBR-friendly for the color map channel** clean grayscale.
- 🎯 **High-Contrast Grid:** Excellent for detecting stretching or pixel blur regardless of the material channel.
- 🔺 **Red Corner Indicators:** Intelligently placed for rotation and alignment aid.
- 🧠 Intuitive for detecting flips, distortions, or overlaps.
- 🧵 Seamless integration with UVEditor tools or UVmesh laid out in multiple tiles.
- 🔢 **Rhino Default Numbers:** Familiar layout and grid cues for seamless Rhino integration.
- 📐 **Coordinate Assistance:** Includes quadrant logic and XY visibility for high-speed orientation.
- 🅰️ **Roboto Font:** Clean and readable numeric indicators using Roboto professional typographic clarity.
- 🔲 **Optimized Edge Outlines:** High-definition edge lines ensure boundary clarity on dense models and seam edges.
- ⚪ **Small Scale Circles:** Micro circles help verify even 2D scaling and unidirectional precition square proportionality.
- ⚖️ **Scale Proportion Circles:** Combines small control circles and large anchor circles for visual proportioning different scale objects.
- ↕️↔️ **Directional Arrows:** for correct UV orientation.
    - Thick upward arrows = vertical orientation  .
    - Thin rightward arrows = horizontal flow  .
- 🗂️ **Region Indicators:** Central axis lines emphasize large-scale quarter segmentation.
- 🖼️ **8K Optimized:** Every feature holds sharpness and readability even in 8K resolutions.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Import the texture into your favorite 3D unwrapping software (e.g., RizomUV, Rhino, Painter, Blender).
2. Apply it to your object’s material
3. Enter UV Editor / Unwrap tool and start unwrapping
4. Adjust UVs for scale uniformity & orientation using the visible numbered cells and arrows

Pro Tip: Use this with reflective or displaced shaders to quickly catch misalignments.
