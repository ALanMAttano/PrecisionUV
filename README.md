üî• A **UV grid checker texture** engineered for professional UV debugging, unwrapping, testing, and alignment across all 3D pipelines. This high-contrast, ultra-readable grid is ideal for determining the optimal resolution for your 3D model and for identifying distortion, flipped UV islands, scaling issues, and seam errors.

üß† Commonly referred to as:
**UVGrid**, **UVCheckerMap**, **UVTestGrid**, **UVMapGuide**, **UVUnwrapGrid**, **UVCheckerTexture**, or **UVDebugMap** ‚Äî this texture consolidates the strengths of all of them into one powerful, go-to default map.

üéÆ Compatible with Rhino, Blender, Unreal Engine, Unity, Substance 3D, RizomUV, and any tool supporting custom UV test textures.

> ‚ÄúA beautiful texture isn't just about surface ‚Äî it's how it maps the soul of geometry.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî *Inspired by the spirit of working with Pininfarina and German Frers*

## üì∏ Example: Rhino UVEditor Use

> This project was inspired by a pro tip shared on the Rhino forums:  
[üîó McNeel Discourse: UV Mapping Tip](https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/uveditor-tip-uv-mapping-replace-your-uv-grid-texture)

> ! [Rhino UV Mapping Example](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/mcneel/uploads/default/original/3X/0/b/0b051d7bcc065e9414fc98e3123168969f20dcd0.mp4)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Import the texture into your preferred 3D application (e.g., RizomUV, Rhino, Blender, Substance).
2. Apply it to the object's base color or diffuse channel.
3. Open the UV Editor and begin your unwrapping process.
4. Adjust UVs for consistent scale, clean orientation, and alignment using numbers, arrows, and grid cues.

üí° **Pro Tip**: Use with reflective or displacement shaders to instantly reveal stretching or seams.

### üõ†Ô∏è Evolution Resume

This texture map is designed for unwrapping various types of 3D models.

I began creating and selling textures in 2007, and by 2011, I was developing blue grid textures specifically for video games. One of the key purposes of these textures is to help determine the optimal texture size, keeping it as small as possible while preserving material detail.

That‚Äôs why I initially used those huge, ugly numbers. Things got even messier when I started adding different materials. lol
Draft but ready early attempts!

Each year, I refine the texture, making it cleaner and more efficient. I began by identifying the features I was using intuitively. Then, by extracting and isolating those elements, I created specific patterns, icons or symbol-shaped objects to handle each individual task.

I didn‚Äôt create the Rhino one, but I use it as inspiration, trying to follow its spirit as closely as possible. The original blue color scheme and font were part of my style, but they ultimately proved too specific and distracting. The same goes for the Rhino font.

I moved toward a more neutral gray and switched to Roboto, a widely used and familiar font, so that it wouldn‚Äôt visually interfere or draw unnecessary attention. I try to remove myself from the design as much as possible and keep pushing by avoiding getting in my own way.
