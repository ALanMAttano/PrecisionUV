I’ve worked hard to reduce the texture size from 12 MB to 371 KB 
and created a procedural version of the UV-Checker-Grid using 
Substance Designer 2023 (v12). It includes:

- `.sbsar` – a compiled procedural texture of just 371 KB !!
- `.sbs` – the fully editable Substance Designer graph.

Why use `.sbsar` instead of a 4K PNG?

- Tiny file size, ideal for downloading apps and plugins
- Generates resolution-independent (1K to 8K) procedurally
- Non-destructive workflow with nodes and logic to play around.
